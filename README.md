# PhraseExpress
A repository for useful phase set  of [PhraseExpress](http://www.phraseexpress.com/)

PhraseExpress is a great automation tool when you type in the phrases, codes, or a series of tedious keyboard shortcuts. By defining some useful phases in advance, it can also be used for very helpful as a kind of cheat sheet. In my Github repository, I share predefined general-purpose phrases files, and a piece of scripts run in PhraseExpress.
